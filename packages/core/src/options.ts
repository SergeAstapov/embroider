  //
  // This option lets you decide which "other" files should be loaded
  // statically. By default, all "other" files will be included in the build and
  // registered with Ember's runtime loader, because we can't know if somebody
  // is going to try to access them dynamically via Ember's resolver or AMD
  // runtime `require`.
  //
  // If you know that your files are only ever imported, you can list them here
  // and then they will only be included exactly where they're needed.
  //
  // Provide a list of directories or files relative to `/app`. For example
  //
  //     staticAppPaths: ['lib']
  //
  // means that everything under your-project/app/lib will be loaded statically.
  //
  // This option has no effect on components (which are governed by
  // staticComponents), helpers (which are governed by staticHelpers), modifiers
  // (which are governed by staticModifiers) or the route-specific files (routes,
  // route templates, and controllers which are governed by splitAtRoutes).

  // This is a performance optimization that can help you avoid the "Your build
  // is slower because some babel plugins are non-serializable" penalty. If you
  // provide the locations of known non-serializable objects, we can discover
  // them and make them serializable.
  //
  // resolve is a list of paths to resolve, in a chain. This lets you resolve
  // your dependencies' dependencies, like: resolve: ['your-dependency',
  // 'inner-dependency/lib/transform']
  //
  // useMethod optionally lets you pick which property within the module to use.
  // If not provided, we use the module.exports itself.
